# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method for linear regression, built entirely from scratch. The project demonstrates the mathematical principles and programming techniques behind OLS regression without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation**: All computations are performed manually without using libraries like Scikit-learn.
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - Fits a linear regression model using the OLS method.
  - Computes coefficients, intercept, and predictions.
  - Includes evaluation metrics like R-squared.
- **Educational Purpose**: The code includes detailed comments to help understand the implementation step-by-step.

## File Structure

- `ols_from_scratch.py`: Python script implementing the OLS method.
- `data/`: dummy dataset for testing the implementation.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/teamarnab/ML-algorithms-built-from-scratch/tree/main/OLS%20from%20scratch

- Go to woring directory: cd ols-from-scratch

- Run the script: python ols_from_scratch.py

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the mathematical foundation of linear regression.
- Learn Python-based implementation of machine learning models.
- Practice working with matrix operations and regression evaluation metrics.
