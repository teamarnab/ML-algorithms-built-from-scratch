# Machine Learning Models from Scratch in Python

This repository contains Python implementations Machine Learning algorithms created from scratch. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental workings of popular machine learning models without relying on external libraries like `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow`. By implementing these models from scratch, you can gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms function internally.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression (OLS)**
   - A simple approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
2. **Gradient Descent**
    - A first-order optimization algorithm used for minimizing a function by iteratively moving toward the steepest descent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the code, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Additionally, you might need to install the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/teamarnab/ML-algorithms-built-from-scratch cd ml-models-from-scratch

Each model is contained in its own Python file. To run a model, simply execute the script from the terminal.


Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new algorithms or improve existing ones, feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request.
